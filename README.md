### Export Format

Playlist data can be exported in [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format with the following fields:

- [Track URI](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/spotify-uris-ids)
- Track Name
- Album Name
- Artist Name(s)
- Release Date
- Duration (ms)
- Popularity
- Added By
- Added At
- Genres
- Record Label
- Danceability
- Energy
- Key
- Loudness
- Mode (Major or Minor)
- Speechiness
- Acousticness
- Instrumentalness
- Liveness
- Valence
- Tempo
- Time Signature

Playlist data can also be exported in [XSPF](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Shareable_Playlist_Format) format like following:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<playlist version="1" xmlns="http://xspf.org/ns/0/">
  <title>playlist title</title>
  <creator>playlist creator</creator>
  <annotation>playlist description</annotation>
  <info>playlist link</info>
  <trackList>
    <track>
      <location>track URI</location>
      <title>track name</title>
      <creator>artist name(s)</creator>
      <album>album name</album>
      <duration>duration(ms)</duration>
    </track>
  </trackList>
</playlist>
```

### Analysis

Run the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/exportify/blob/master/taste_analysis.ipynb) or [launch it in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pavelkomarov/exportify/master) to get a variety of plots about the music in a playlist including:

- Most common artists
- Most common genres
- Release date distribution
- Popularity distribution
- Your songs' distributions of Acousticness, Valence, etc.
- Time signatures and keys
- All songs plotted in 2D to indicate relative similarities


### Development

Most of the interesting logic that communicates with the Spotify Web API happens in Javascript in `exportify.js`. I've left many detailed code comments and tried to structure it as rationally as I can, so take a look. The webpage skin and a few action bindings are defined in `index.html`.

To experiment with changes, run a local web server. For example, using Python (in the Exportify repo dir):

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The Javascript can be invoked by interacting with this locally-served webpage.

Data science stuff is written with Python in `taste_analysis.ipynb`, which you can run with `python3 -m notebook`, then navigating to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
